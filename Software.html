<h3>Instructions:</h3>
Instructions is the basic command given to the computer to perform some tasks.

<h3>Program:</h3>
Program is the set of instructions given to the computer to perform some tasks.

<h3>Software:</h3>
Software is the set of program that makes computer hardware functioning.It perform it's specific task.<br>
Softwares are categorized into three types.They are:

<ol type="a">      <!-- This is for the types of softwares -->
	
<li class="h3">System Software:</li>
System Software is the set of programs that <font>controls, Manages and operates all the activities of computer.</font>It also allows to develop other programs.<br>
There are four parts of system software and they are:

<ol type="1">      <!-- This is for the parts of system software. -->

	<li class="h3">OSS (Operating System Software):</li>
		OSS refers to the Operating System Software.<font>It controls, manages and operates the overall activities of computer.</font>It executes other applications.It acts as a interface between computer hardware and users.<br>Some examples of OSS are: <font>Windows 7. windows 8, windows 10, android, ios, linux and so on.</font><br>
		There are two types of OSS and they are:

<ol type="I">      <!-- This is for the types of oss -->
		
	<li class="h3">Single user and single tasking OSS</li>	
	The operating system which allows only one users at a time.It performs only one task at a time.<br>
	For eg:<font>MS DOS</font>


	<li class="h3">Multi user and multi tasking OSS</li>
	The operating system that allows more than one user at a time.It performs varieties or multiples tasks ata a time.<br>
	For eg:<font>Linux, Windows servers, Windows NT, Novel netware, and so on.</font>

</ol>              <!-- This is for the closing of types of oss -->



<p class="h3">Function of OSS</p>

<ol type="i">               <!-- This is fot the function of OSS -->

<li class="active">Input/Output device management.</li>
<li class="active">Processing management.</li>
<li class="active">File management</li>
<li class="active">Memory management.</li>
<li class="h3">Provides user interface</li>
	User interface is the environment provides by OSS by which users interact with the computer.<br>
	There are two types of user interface and they are:

<ol type="1">                <!-- This is for the types of user interface -->

	<li class="h3">GUI(Graphical_User_Interface):</li>
	GUI refers to the Graphical Users Interface.It is very easier to work in GUI.It provides the Graphical working environment to the users.Such as:<font>Icons, Buttons, Dialogue box, Text box, List box and so many others which we can see on our today's digital computers.</font>

	<li class="h3"> CUI(Command_User_Interface) or CLI(Command_Line_Interface):</li>
	CUI refers to the Command User Interface and CLI refers to the Command Line Interface.It doesnot provides the graphical working environment to the users. Users should type the command in order to get results.

</ol>                      <!-- This is the closing of types of user interface -->	

</ol>                      <!-- This is the closing of Function of OSS -->

<li class="h3">Utility Software:</li>
Utility softwares is the set of programs that <font>checks the system errors, repairs them and keeps personal computer healthy.</font><br>
For eg:<font>Antivirus, Scan disk, Disk defragmanter, Disk clean up and so on that makes pc works faster.</font>

<li class="h3">Device Driver:</li>
Device Driver is the set of programs that <font>detects the new hardware component and makes functioning.</font><br> For eg:<font>Printer driver, Scanner driver, Keyboard driver, etc.</font>

<li class="h3">Language Processsor:</li>
Language processor is the program that <font>converts the program written low level language and high level language into machine level language(Machine code).</font><br>
For eg:<font>Assembler, Compiler and Interpreter.</font>

<ol type="a">      <!-- This is for the examples of language processor. -->
	
	<li class="h3">Assembler</li>
Assembler is a language translator that <font>translate the programs written in Assembly language into Machine code that is 0 and 1.</font>


	<li class="h3">Interpreter</li>
Interpreter is a language processor that <font>converts the program written in high level language into Machine code.It converts the one statement of a program at a time.</font> 

	<li class="h3">Compiler</li>
Compiler is a language processor that <font>converts the program written in High level language into machine code.It converts the whole statement of a program at a time.</font>

</ol>      <!-- This is the closing of examples of language processor. -->


</ol>              <!-- This is the closing of parts of system software -->

	<li class="h3">Application Software</li>
 Application software is the set of programs <font>that is designed to perform the specific task.It acts as a interface between user and operating system software.</font>For eg: <mark>Ms-Excel, Ms-Powerpoint, Adobe photoshop, Medi-pro, Fact, Tally, etc.</mark> There are two types of Application software and they are:


<ol>          <!-- This is for the types of Application software. -->
	
	<li class="h3">Packaged Software</li>
Packaged software is the set of programs that is <font>designed by another group of company to meets the requirenents of a user.</font> For eg: <mark>Ms-Excel, Ms-Powerpoint, Adobe photoshop, etc. </mark>

	<li class="h3">Customized or Tailored Software.</li>
Customized or Tailored Software is the set of programs that is <font>made on the demand of users. Specially, customized software is used for account management, Salary management, Inventory management, etc.</font> For eg:<mark> Medi-pro, Fact, Tally, etc.</mark>


</ol>          <!-- This is the closing of types of Application software. -->

	<li class="h3">Programming language</li>
Programming language is a computer language that is used to develop programs. For eg: COBOL(Common Business Oriented Language), FORTRAN(Formula Translator), QBASIC(Quick Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), Java, C, C++, PHP(Personal Home Page), Pearl, Python, Ruby, Milk, Anguler, PROLOG(Programmation en Logique), etc.
There are three types of programming language and they are:

<ol>       <!-- This is for the types of Programming language -->
	
	<li class="h3">Machine Level Language.</li>	
Machine level language is a computer language <font>in which all the programs are written in the form of 0 and 1.It is machine dependent language</font> and difficult to write the programs.


	<li class="h3">Assembly language.</li>
Assembly language is a programming language in which <font>programs are written by using alpha numeric word called Mneumonics.</font>Programs are written like in commands:<mark>Add, Sub, Mpy, Cmp, etc.</mark>


	<li class="h3">High Level language.</li>
High level language is a programming language in which <font>programs are written by using English Words.</font>It is easier to write the programs and it is a Machine dependent language. For eg:<mark>QBASIC, FORTRAN, C, C++, Java, Pearl, Python, etc. </mark>


</ol>       <!-- This is the closing of types of Programming language -->

	<li class="h3">Open source software</li>
open source software is the type of software that <font>allows to use, modify the source code and develop another software without permission of owner.</font> <mark>For eg: PHP, Mysql, Linux, etc.</mark>


	<li clas="h3">Note:</li>

	<ol class="a">      <!-- This for extra -->

	<li class="h3">Freeware</li>
The software which is <font>freely available to use without paying any cost are called freeware.</font> For eg: Browsers, Games available in Play store or App store and so many other application which can be use freely.


	<li class="h3">Web application</li>
Web application are the server based application that needs internet connection to run. Information are stored in server computer which are provided to the clients. For eg: <mark>Facebook, Youtube, All the web browsers, Online service providing app, online games like: COC, Free Fire, PUBG, Call of duty, and so on.</mark>


<li class="h3">Desktop application</li>
Desktop application are not based on servers so that we can we use them without accessing of internet.In other word, <font>those application which are designed to used offline and doesnot required internet service to run is called Desktop application.</font>They can be use directly after installation on the computer. For eg:<mark>Ms office, VLC media player, Windows media player, and so many other offline application used in desktop or laptop computers.</mark>
