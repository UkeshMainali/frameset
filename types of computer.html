			<li class="h3">Micro Computer</li>
The smmallest and personal computer in the world is called micro computer.It can support only one user at a time.It has low processing speed and power.It is used in school, house, movie animation, etc.There are five types of micro computer and they are: 

				<ol type="i">                 <!-- This is for the types of micro computer. -->

					<li class="h3">Desktop Computer</li>

The computer which is kept in desk while using is called desktop computers. It has external or detached CPU, mouse, monitor, keyboard, scanner, webcam, etc.It is not porable.It donot have battery backup power.

					<li class="h3">Laptop computers</li>
The computer which is kept in lap while using is called Laptop computers. It has internal or attached  CPU, mouse, monitor, keyboard, scanner, webcam, etc.It is easily porable by kepping inside the bag everywhere. It can be used in those place where there is no electricity because it has battery backup power.

					<li class="h3">Tablet computers</li>
Tablet computer is smaller than laptop and bigger than palmheld computer.It is used by keeping in two palm together.It has battery backup power.it is more portable than laptop as it can fit inside pocket.It has internal or attached CPU, touchscreen, monitor, keyboard(Screen touch), scanner, webcam, etc.It is not porable.We can easily operate by touching tha screen by our fingers.


					<li class="h3">Palmheld computer</li>
The computer which is kept in palm while using is called palmheld computers.It is smaller than tablet computer. It has internal or attached CPU, touch screen, monitor, keyboard, scanner, webcam, etc.It is more porable than tablet computer as it can be opetated by one palm.It has battery backup power.For eg:smart phone.

					<li class="h3">Wearable Computers</li>
The computer that can be wear on body is called wearable computer.For eg:Smart watch, digital bracelet, digitall costumes, etc.It has battery backup facilities.It is the most portable device as it can be wear on our body.

		<ol type="a">             <!-- This is for the on the basis of task. -->

	<li class="h3">Analog Compuiter</li>
The computer which works on continous flow of data is called Analog computer.
They can do only one specific task.
For eg: Speedometer is only use to measure speed of bykes, Sismograph is only used to measure vibration, Thermometer is only used to measure temperature.


	<li class="h3">Digital computer</li>
The computer that works on descreate data like :audio, video, text, animation, graphic, etc. is called Digital Computer.
It performs work in the form of 0 and 1.
It can perform varieties of task.
such as: Laptop, desktop, palmheld, tablet computers, etc are used to listen music, make animation, make video and editing, make programs play games, etc.



	<li class="h3">Hybrid computer</li>
The computer which have capabilities of both analog and digital computer is called Hybrid computer.
They are used in :Airplanes, Ships, Factory, HOspitals, CT-scan machine ECG machine, etc.
They can do only one specific task.

<li class="h3">On the basis of brand</li>

<ol type="a">           <!-- This is for the on the basis of brand. -->

<li class="h3">IBM computers</li>
The computers developed by IBM company is called IBM computer.
They used microsoft based software.
It is a personal computer


<li class="h3">IBM compatible</li>
The computer which is made by other company except IBM company is called IBM compatible.
They follow or works in the principle of IBM computer
They also used microsoft based software.


<li class="h3">Apple mac</li>
The computer which is made by Apple company is called Apple mac computer.
They used their own made software due to that reason chance of spreading viruses in apple mac computer is very low.
They have different lookuo, shape,  and size.

<h1 class="h1">Generation of computer.</h1>

<ol type="1">         <!-- This is for the generation of computer. -->
	<li class="h3">First generation of computer</li>
First generation of computer were developed during 1946 AD to 1958 AD.
They use vacuum tubes as a main electronic component. 
They are very slow in performance, and perform attacks in milliseconds. 
They were programmed in missing language. 
They will large in size and consume high electric power. 

	<li class="h3">Second generation of computer</li>
Second generation computer were developed during 1959 AD to 1964 AD. 
They used transistors as a main electronic component. 
They were faster and perform their tasks in a microsecond. They were programmed in Machine language, assembly and high level language. 

	<li class="h3">Third generation of computer</li>
Third generation computer were developed during 1965 AD to 1974 AD. They use IC (Integrated Circuit as a main electronic component. 
They were more faster than previous computer and perform their tasks in nanosecond. They use operating system, and could run different programs. 

	<li class="h3">Fourth generation of computer</li>
Fourth generation computer is developed in 1975 AD to onwards. 
They use VLSI(Very Large Scale Integration) and LSI(large Scale Integration) as a main electronic component. Their processing speed is increased and measured in pico second. They are more versatile and diligence.

	<li class="h3">Fifth generation of computer</li>
Fifth generation computer is developed in present and will be in future. They use ULSI(Ultra Large Scale Integration) or biochips as a main electronic component. 
They have AI(Artificial Intelligence). They can think themselves, 
use intelligent programs,  
understand natural language, etc. They will have multi processors and parallel processing capability.
