	<h3>Introduction</h3>

<ol type="a">           <!-- This is for the introduction part. -->

 	<li class="h3">Computer:</li>
Computer stands for Commonly Operating Machine Particular Use Tread Education And Rasearch.
<font>It is an electronic device that perform tasks in th principle of IPO(Input Processing Unit).Now a days computer is being one of the essential things for our life and in our modern world every work related to every field is being done with the help of computer.It is used for money transaction, online shopping, to pay bill in online, movie making, entertainment sector, record keeping, news telecasting, to get online eduaction and so on. </font>

	<li class="h3">Data:</li>
<font>Data is an raw fact or figure which may be letters, numbers, words or any symbol.</font>
 It doesnot gives complete meaning.

	<li class="h3">Information:</li>
<font>Information is a output which we get after processing a data.</font>
It gives complete meaning

	<li class="h3" >Instruction:</li>
<font>The basic command that tells what type of action shouls be taken by Computer is called Introduction.</font>

	<li class="h3">Computer system:</li>
<font> Computer system is the combination of both computer hardware and software.</font>Hardware and Software works together to get meaningful information.


	<li class="h3">Program:</li>
<font>The set of Instruction given to the computer to perform some task is called Program.</font>

	<li class="h3">Software:</li>
<font>The group of program that tell the Computer to perform some specific task is called Software.</font>

	<li class="h3">Cache memory:</li>
<font> Cache memory is the fastest memory located between primary memory and CPU.</font>

	</ol>           <!-- This is the cloasing of introduction part. -->

	<h3>Function of Computer:</h3>

<ol type="a">         <!-- This is for the function of computer. -->

<li class="h3"> Input:</li>
<font>Data and instruction whatever entered through the help of input device is called input.</font>
we can give command into computer by typing,touching on device through input device like:Keyboard,Mouse,Touchscreen,Touchpad,Joystick,etc.

	<li class="h3">Process:</li>
<font>Process meant to treat the data accoarding to instruction given by the users.</font>
It is done through processing device and i.e CPU(Central Processing Unit).

	<li class="h3">Output:</li>
<font>The result which we obtain after processing through the help of output device os called Output.</font>
We get output in printed and unprinted form through different output devices like:Monitor,Speaker,Printer,Projector,Plotter,etc.

	<li class="h3">Storage:</li>
<font>The place on the Computer where we stores data,information,files,etc either permanently or temporarily.</font>
We can transfer files whenever we want through storage device.

<h3>Features/Characterstics of Computer</h3>

<ol type="a">             <!-- This is for the characterstics of computer -->
	
	<li class="h3">Speed</li>
Computer is a fast machine. It performs its task within a fraction of second. Speed of computer is measured in MIPS.	
<h3>Fraction of second.</h3>
<ul type="circle">
	<li class="active">1 second = 1,000 Millisecond</li>
	<li class="active">1 second = 10,00,000 Microsecond</li>
	<li class="active">1 second = 1,00,00,00,000 Nano second</li>
	<li class="active">1 second = 10,00,00,00,00,000 Pico second</li>


</ul>

	<li class="h3">Accuracy</li>
Computer is an accurate machine. It gives hundred percent accurate result. It never does any mistake. 

	<li class="h3">Automatic</li>
Computer needs data nad instrauction. After getting data and instruction it does it's task automatically.

	<li class="h3">Diligence</li>
Computer is a diligent machine. It performs the same tasks repeatily without losing speed and accuracy.

	<li class="h3">Versatile</li>
Computer is a versatile machine. It can perform variety of task and because of that reason computer is being used in many different field.

	<li class="h3">Storage</li>
The place where we stores our data, informations, files and folder on the computre is called storage.It stores files temprorarily as well as permanently.

	<h3>Measures of data in computer memory:</h3>

<ul type="circle">            <!-- This is for the measures of data -->

<li class="active">0, 1 = BIT(Binary Digit) </li>
<li class="active">2 Bits = 1 Crumb</li>
<li class="active">4 Bits = 1 Nibble</li>
<li class="active">8 Bits = 1 Byte(One character)</li>
<li class="active">1024 Bytes = 1 KB(Kilo Bytes)</li>
<li class="active">1024 KB = 1 MB(Mega Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 MB = 1 GB(Giga Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 GB = 1 TB(Tera Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 TB = 1 PB(Peta Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 PB = 1 EB(Exa Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 EB = 1 ZB(Zotta Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 ZB = 1 YB(Yotta Byte)</li>


</ul>              <!-- This is the closing of measures of data -->


	<li class="h3">GIGO(Garbage In Garbage Out)</li>
GIGO is the terms that describes if the input is wrong then the output will also become wrong. It stands for Garbage In Garbage Out.

	<li class="h3">Bug</li>
Bug is an error which comes due to the malfunctioning of hardware and programs.

	<li class="h3">Debug</li>
The process of removing error that comes due to the malfunctioning of hardware and programs is called debug.

	<li class="h3">Word Length</li>
The data handling capacity of a computer per second is called word length.For Examples: 32 bits of computer process the 32 bits of data per second.

<li class="h3">AI(Artificial Intelligence)</li>
AI is the features of computer.It has thinking, learning, decision making skill, feeling, capability of doing work itself, and so on. It stands for Artificial intelligence.
