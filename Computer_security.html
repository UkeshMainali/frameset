		<h3 class="h3">Computer Security</h3>
The protection given to the computer hardware and software from being lost, damage, theft, disaster and other intentional harm is called computer security. 

	<h3 class="h3">Types of Computer Security</h3>

	<ol type="1">            <!-- This is for the types of computer security. -->
		
		<li class="h3">Hardware security</li>
The protection given to the computer hardware from being lost, damage, theft and other intentional harms is called hardware security.  

	<h3 class="h3">Hardware security measures </h3>

	<ol type="a">        <!-- This is for the Hardware security measures -->

	<li class="h3">Regular maintenance.</li>
Hardware component is an important part of a computer. We have to check all the hardware parts time to time. If there is any error., we should repair them. 

	
	<li class="h3">Free from dust.</li>
Dust particles are the major causes of the failure of computer hardware that can damage different parts. We should clean the hardware parts time to time to secure the computer system. 

	<li class="h3">Insurance.</li>
Insurance is an important for the security of  property. Computer and information stored in computer are also the property. So that we should insure the computer, we can get the insurance money for any lost and damage.  

	<li class="h3">protection from fire.</li>
Fire is one of the major destructive things.We should regularly check the wires and connector to avoid fire by minimizing short circuit.We should not play with fire in computer room because slight carelessnes of leads to danger. So, we should protect our hardware from fire otherwise our property will be loose and our self life also. 	


	<li class="h3">Protection from theft.</li>
Theft is a kind of social evil so that we should protect the computer from theft. We should lock our main gate, windows, doors of home/building strongly. We can use the CCTC camera to observe environment of home. 

	<li class="h3">Air condition system.</li>
Computer automatically creates heat, over heat can damage the computer. So that computer room should be ventilated and fresh air should be flowed in a room. We should maintain the temperature of computer room 20 to 24 degree Celsius.  

	<li class="h3">Use of power protection devices.</li> 
Some power protection devices can be used to protect the electronic devices such as computer, radio, TV, mobile etc. from the fluctuation of electricity. They are 

	<h3 class="h3">Power protection device </h3>

	<ol type="i">                  <!-- This is for the power protective device. -->

	<li class="h3">UPS  (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</li>
UPS is a power protection device. It has battery backup power. It protects the computer system from power failure and fluctuation of electricity and provides constant voltage to the computer.   

	<li class="h3">Volt Guard</li>
Volt Guard is a power protection device that controls the fluctuation (High and low voltage) of electric voltage and provides constant voltage  to the computer system. Computer requires 220 volt to 240 volt of constant voltage.     

	<li class="h3">Spike Guard</li>
Spike means sudden over voltage of electricity. Spike guard protects the device from the sudden over voltage of current such as lightning. 

	<li class="h3">Voltage stabilizer</li> 
Voltage stabilizer is common power protection device that protects the computer from frequent power failure of voltage fluctuation.

	</ol>                      <!-- This is for the closing of Hardware security measures -->

	<li class="h3">Data and software security</li> 
The protection given to the software from being loss, damage and other intentional harm is called software security. Software as well as data security is also major part because they have important role in any organization.   

	<h3 class="h3">Software security measures </h3>

	<ol type="a">                      <!-- This is for the Software security measures -->

	<li class="h3">Password protection.</li>
Password is a secret word or alphanumeric word that protects the data, information and software from the unauthorized access of computer system. Password policy is available in a computer system.    		

	<li class="h3">Biometric.</li>
Biometric is a technology that uses finger print, facial recognition, retina recognition, voice, digital signature for the security of data and information in computers system instead of password. It is more secure than the password policy.     		

	<li class="h3">Backup system.</li>
Backup is the process of copying data and programs into another location or creating duplicate copy of its in a secured place. Backup system is important to save the data and programs from the accidental or intentional harm. We can recover data and programs if they are lost. 		

	<li class="h3">USB port block.</li>
Hard lock key and USB port block is a data security mechanism. Some specific programs are used to lock the Hard Disk Drive and USB port. It protects the data from the unauthorized access of computer. 

	<li class="h3">Defragmentation.</li>
Disk Defragmentation is a software security measure that defrags the fragmented files of hard disk drive. It help to increase the performance of computer system. Disk Defragmenter is used to defrag the files on the disk.  

<li class="h3">Scan disk.</li>
	<li class="h3">Antivirus.</li>
Antivirus is a Utility software that detects and removes the virus from the computer and keeps PC healthy like medicine.

	<li class="h3">Message carrying virus</li>
Message carrying virus does not infect the programs and files. It displays the unwanted picture or message on the screen and irritates the computer user. 
 
	<li class="h3">Computer worm</li>
Computer worm is a malicious program that does not infect other files. It replicates itself or creates multiple copies itself. Mainly, it blocks the internet connection and increases the network traffic.    

	<li class="h3">Trojan horse</li>
Trojan horse is a malicious program that appears as a game, antivirus etc. when it is installed into the computer, it helps to the hacker to bypass the sensitive information such as banking information, password or personal identity to the hacker.  

	<li class="h3">Polymorphic virus</li>
Polymorphic virus is a complex file infector that changes/modifies its appearance in every infection. It encrypts its code to secure from the antivirus. 

	<li class="h3">Stealth virus</li>
Stealth virus is a malware that uses various mechanisms to avoid detection by antivirus. It causes unrecognized icon appears, affects the printing devices, computer starts automatically, a system may crash without reason.
