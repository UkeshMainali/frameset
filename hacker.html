<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Introduction to Hacking</font></u><br>
<p>Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad discipline, which covers a wide range of topics. The first known event of hacking had taken place in 1960 at MIT and at the same time, the term "Hacker" was originated.
</p>

<p>Hacking is the act of finding the possible entry points that exist in a computer system or a computer network and finally entering into them. Hacking is usually done to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or a computer network, either to harm the systems or to steal sensitive information available on the computer.
</p>

<p>Hacking is usually legal as long as it is being done to find weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose. This sort of hacking is what we call Ethical Hacking.
</p>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Introduction to Hacker.</font></u><br>
<p>A computer expert who does the act of hacking is called a "Hacker". Hackers are those who seek knowledge, to understand how systems operate, how they are designed, and then attempt to play with these systems.
</p>
</li>



<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Types of hacking :</font></u><br>
<p>We can segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked. Here is a set of examples −</p>

<ol type="a">

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Website Hacking</font></u><br>
<p> Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a web server and its associated software such as databases and other interfaces.
</p>
</li>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Network Hacking</font></u><br>
<p>Hacking a network means gathering information about a network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert, Netstat, etc. with the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation.
</p>
</li>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Email Hacking</font></u><br>
<p> It includes getting unauthorized access on an Email account and using it without taking the consent of its owner.
</p>
</li>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Ethical Hacking</font></u><br>
<p> Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed.
</p>
</li>


</li>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Password Hacking</font></u><br>
<p>This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.
</p>
</li>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Computer Hacking</font></u><br>
<p>This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer system.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Advantages of Hacking</font></u><br>
<p>Hacking is quite useful in the following scenarios −
</p>

<ul type="square">
<li>To recover lost information, especially in case you lost your password.
</li>

<li>To perform penetration testing to strengthen computer and network security.
</li>

<li>To put adequate preventative measures in place to prevent security breaches.
</li>

<li> To have a computer system that prevents malicious hackers from gaining access.
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Disadvantages of Hacking:</font></u><br>
<p>Hacking is quite dangerous if it is done with harmful intent. It can cause −
</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Massive security breach.
</li>

<li>Unauthorized system access on private information.
</li>

<li>Privacy violation.
</li>

<li>Hampering system operation.
</li>

<li>Denial of service attacks.
</li>

<li>Malicious attack on the system.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><u><font color="red"size="4">Purpose of Hacking:</font></u><br>
<p>There could be various positive and negative intentions behind performing hacking activities. Here is a list of some probable reasons why people indulge in hacking activities −
</p>

<ul type="square">
<li>Just for fun
</li>

<li>Show-off
</li>

<li>Steal important information
</li>

<li>Damaging the system
</li>

<li>Hampering privacy
