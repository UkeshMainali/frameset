	<h3>Introduction</h3>

<ol type="a">           <!-- This is for the introduction part. -->

 	<li class="h3">Computer:</li>
Computer stands for Commonly Operating Machine Particular Use Tread Education And Rasearch.
<font>It is an electronic device that perform tasks in th principle of IPO(Input Processing Unit).</font>

	<li class="h3">Data:</li>
<font>Data is an raw fact or figure which may be letters, numbers, words or any symbol.</font>
 It doesnot gives complete meaning.

	<li class="h3">Information:</li>
<font>Information is a output which we get after processing a data.</font>
It gives complete meaning

	<li class="h3" >Instruction:</li>
<font>The basic command that tells what type of action shouls be taken by Computer is called Introduction.</font>

	<li class="h3">Computer system:</li>
<font> Computer system is the combination of both computer hardware and software.</font>Hardware and Software works together to get meaningful information.


	<li class="h3">Program:</li>
<font>The set of Instruction given to the computer to perform some task is called Program.</font>

	<li class="h3">Software:</li>
<font>The group of program that tell the Computer to perform some specific task is called Software.</font>

	<li class="h3">Cache memory:</li>
<font> Cache memory is the fastest memory located between primary memory and CPU.</font>

	</ol>           <!-- This is the cloasing of introduction part. -->

	<h3>Function of Computer:</h3>

<ol type="a">         <!-- This is for the function of computer. -->

<li class="h3"> Input:</li>
<font>Data and instruction whatever entered through the help of input device is called input.</font>
we can give command into computer by typing,touching on device through input device like:Keyboard,Mouse,Touchscreen,Touchpad,Joystick,etc.

	<li class="h3">Process:</li>
<font>Process meant to treat the data accoarding to instruction given by the users.</font>
It is done through processing device and i.e CPU(Central Processing Unit).

	<li class="h3">Output:</li>
<font>The result which we obtain after processing through the help of output device os called Output.</font>
We get output in printed and unprinted form through different output devices like:Monitor,Speaker,Printer,Projector,Plotter,etc.

	<li class="h3">Storage:</li>
<font>The place on the Computer where we stores data,information,files,etc either permanently or temporarily.</font>
We can transfer files whenever we want through storage device.

<h3>Features/Characterstics of Computer</h3>

<ol type="a">             <!-- This is for the characterstics of computer -->
	
	<li class="h3">Speed</li>
Computer is a fast machine. It performs its task within a fraction of second. Speed of computer is measured in MIPS.	
<h3>Fraction o second.</h3>
<ul type="circle">
	<li class="active">1 second = 1,000 Millisecond</li>
	<li class="active">1 second = 10,00,000 Microsecond</li>
	<li class="active">1 second = 1,00,00,00,000 Nano second</li>
	<li class="active">1 second = 10,00,00,00,00,000 Pico second</li>


</ul>

	<li class="h3">Accuracy</li>
Computer is an accurate machine. It gives hundred percent accurate result. It never does any mistake. 

	<li class="h3">Automatic</li>
Computer needs data nad instrauction. After getting data and instruction it does it's task automatically.

	<li class="h3">Diligence</li>
Computer is a diligent machine. It performs the same tasks repeatily without losing speed and accuracy.

	<li class="h3">Versatile</li>
Computer is a versatile machine. It can perform variety of task and because of that reason computer is being used in many different field.

	<li class="h3">Storage</li>
The place where we stores our data, informations, files and folder on the computre is called storage.It stores files temprorarily as well as permanently.

	<h3>Measures of data in computer memory:</h3>

<ul type="circle">            <!-- This is for the measures of data -->

<li class="active">0, 1 = BIT(Binary Digit) </li>
<li class="active">2 Bits = 1 Crumb</li>
<li class="active">4 Bits = 1 Nibble</li>
<li class="active">8 Bits = 1 Byte(One character)</li>
<li class="active">1024 Bytes = 1 KB(Kilo Bytes)</li>
<li class="active">1024 KB = 1 MB(Mega Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 MB = 1 GB(Giga Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 GB = 1 TB(Tera Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 TB = 1 PB(Peta Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 PB = 1 EB(Exa Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 EB = 1 ZB(Zotta Byte)</li>
<li class="active">1024 ZB = 1 YB(Yotta Byte)</li>


</ul>              <!-- This is the closing of measures of data -->


	<li class="h3">GIGO(Garbage In Garbage Out)</li>
GIGO is the terms that describes if the input is wrong then the output will also become wrong. It stands for Garbage In Garbage Out.

	<li class="h3">Bug</li>
Bug is an error which comes due to the malfunctioning of hardware and programs.

	<li class="h3">Debug</li>
The process of removing error that comes due to the malfunctioning of hardware and programs is called debug.

	<li class="h3">Word Length</li>
The data handling capacity of a computer per second is called word length.For Examples: 32 bits of computer process the 32 bits of data per second.

<li class="h3">AI(Artificial Intelligence)</li>
AI is the features of computer.It has thinking, learning, decision making skill, feeling, capability of doing work itself, and so on. It stands for Artificial intelligence.


</ol>                     <!-- This is the closing of characterstics of computer. -->
