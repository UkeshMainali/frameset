	<li class="h3">Cloud Computing</li>
Cloud computing is a technology that allows us to store, process, operate, and access the data,
information, files and softwares.

	<h3 class="h3">Types of Cloud:</h3>

	<ol type="a">                     <!-- This is for the typs of cloud. -->

		<li class="h3">Public cloud</li>
In simple terms, the public cloud is a vast array of readily available compute resources such as networking, memory, central processing unit (CPU) and storage. These resources are hosted in one of the public cloud vendor’s globally distributed and fully managed data centers and you can rent these resources to build an IT infrastructure.
These basic compute resources are coupled with managed services like database servers, applications and security systems. The managed services are there for you to rent if you don’t want the hassle of setting up and managing the whole solution. The leading providers of this type of cloud offering are Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, however there are others. Accessing your resources in this type of cloud can be a simple as using a web browser.

	<h3 class="h3">Benifits of public cloud:</h3>
One of the great benefits of the public cloud is that the underlying hardware and logic is hosted, owned and maintained by each of those vendors. This means that customers have no responsibility for buying or maintaining the physical components that make up their public cloud IT solutions.
The “pay-as-you-go” model used to charge for these resources makes them a more cost effective solution than owning them yourself as you only pay for what you consume. The ability to scale the size of your solution up to accomodate for the peaks and troughs in usage saves the customer money, and also gives huge flexibility.
Lastly, financially backed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) commit each vendor to a monthly uptime percentage and guarantee of security in line with standards such as GDPR, FIPS, HIPAPA etc. With this in mind, the public cloud vendors have invested, and continue to invest, 10s of billions of pounds in their data centers so they can be provisioned with state of the art fault tolerant power supplies, network paths, storage facilities and automated monitoring and maintenance systems to meet these SLAs.


		<li class="h3">Private cloud</li>
Private clouds are owned and used by single private businesses and organisations. They have traditionally been physically located at the business’s own data centre using its own hardware.
However, a business may employ a third-party provider to host their private cloud on their kit. In that scenario, private cloud does have some similarities to public cloud in that the resources are in a remotely managed data center. However, although these providers will offer administrative services, they will only be able to offer a tiny percentage of the global services of a public cloud.

	<h3 class="h3">Benefits of private cloud</h3>
If the private cloud is being hosted in your own data center then there is the benefit of being able to fully control the entire solution yourself.
As you have complete control over the infrastructure, you can tailor your cloud computing approach to your own preferences and internal processes. Some of the more stringent security and compliance legislation insists on certain types of data and resources being kept inside your own security boundary - a self-hosted private cloud will help to comply with this.

		<li class="h3">Hybrid cloud</li>
A hybrid cloud is the combination of public and private cloud elements connected securely over the internet by virtual private network (VPN) or a dedicated private channel.
For example, you could use the near unlimited storage capacity of the public cloud for storage while data processing could happen on your premises. Or you could extend your computer network in to the cloud to save having to buy in additional permanent hardware.

	<h3 class="h3">Benefits of hybrid cloud</h3>
A hybrid cloud solution offers benefits from the best of both options and makes cloud cloud bursting possible. In the example of extending your private cloud network, this means that if you are running out of compute capacity on premise, it can be supplied by the public cloud. This is a cost-effective way for businesses to increase compute capacity on demand while still utilising the already paid for on premise resources.
